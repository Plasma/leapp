# Integrations

The idea behind Integrations is to integrate external services into the Leapp's flow, in order to embrace your specific Use Case.
For example, you could integrate Leapp's flow with an external Identity Provider where you store and manage your Users, or Keychain where you want your credentials to be stored in.
Following this concept, we added support to AWS SSO; through this integration, Leapp is able to retrieve Session information and obtain temporary credentials associated to them.
